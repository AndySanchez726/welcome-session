    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Ayo this is just me practicing sending things to github.</p>
    <p>Pretty simple to do, I should be able to remember this 
        fairly easy.
    </p>
    <p>This is dope, I'm stoked to get working!</p>
    <p>With the previous update I used "git add index.html" 
        instead of "git add . " just to make sure I understand.
